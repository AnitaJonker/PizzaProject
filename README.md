# PizzaProject
Let's build an application

1. I build the front-end first
2. Then build the back-end learning how to use Ruby and Rails definitley took quite a bit of time.
3. Then I had to set up the api call - I didn’t get to work too much with the api I would have like to experiment and actually get all the webhooks going but I ran out of time.
4. Learning Ruby and building a controllers and views and working with routes was quite a learning curve but I enjoyed it. The biggest fight for today was the api and global variables. Everyday there were quite a bit of challenges.
    - One of the main issues was storing an environment variable my terminal/windows did not save any. So attempting to save the url in a file to ignore it by git and then needing to access that… took time.
5. Ending up commiting my api-keys on github and needing to learn how to use rebase was defenitley an extra challenge that will make me a lot more careful in the future when commiting to public repositories.
